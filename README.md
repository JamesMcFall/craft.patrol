### TL;DR

### FAQ

---
#### @Maintenance Mode
##### How do I give users access when maintenance mode is enabled?
- You can add their **IP** to the _Authorized IPs_ list
- Logged in users with **admin** permissions have full access by default

##### How do I authorize [BeanStalk](http://beanstalkapp.com) so I can deploy if maintenance mode is enabled?
- Find the IP range for **BeanStalk** or any other service: `50.31.189.108 â€“ 50.31.189.122`
- Add a partial IP to the _Authorized List_: `50.31.189.1 or 50.31.189.1**`

##### Will IP authentication work if my site is behind [CloudFlare](http://cloudflare.com)?
- **Yes**, CloudFlare provides the user's IP via a header that Patrol understands

##### Doesn't Craft have a maintenance mode setting?
- **Yes**, but it's meant for internal use only to handle updates

#### @Security
##### How do I force SSL on the CP?
- Click on the **Secure The CP** button and save your settings
- Add `/{cpTrigger}` to the _Restricted Areas_

##### How do I for SSL on my whole site?
- Leave the _restricted areas_ blank

##### How do I force SSL on a specific URL, like my login page?
- You can add something like `/members/login` to the _restricted areas_

##### How do I force SSL on a specific section of the my site, like my members section?
- You can add the section URL `/members` and URLs on that scope will be restricted

### Notes
1. The CP is accessible even if **maintenance mode** is turned on to avoid lockouts
3. Patrol will go **off duty** if **devMode** is turned on regardless of its settings
4. Settings are exported in `JSON` format
